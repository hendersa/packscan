Thanks to LuigiBlood for the clarification.
- Fixed option parsing.
- Replaced those '\n' EOLs with std::endl.
- Added check to discard a potential header if it has no blocks allocated.
- Changed the main data buffer from std::string to std::vector<uint8_t>.
- Added "-Wall -Werror -pedantic" to CXXFLAGS in the Makefile and cleaned up evertyhing being reported.
